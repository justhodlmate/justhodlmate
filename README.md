- 👋 Hi, I’m @justhodlmate
- 👀 I’m interested in helping some ppl with the projects to dive into coding. I don't really know much, just want to start with coding but don't really know where.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS (since Q1 2021) and Swift (since Q3 2022). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites or apps/games to learn more stuff.
- 📫 You can reach me on Github.
